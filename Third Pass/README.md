# Third Pass

## Differences from Previous Phase

- Added Basic Persona context
- Generated Separate Modules for each persona
- Inital analysis max tokens increased from 1500 - 5000 due to context length

## Observations

- The "Developer" persona content appears smaller in size compared to the "Student" persona across all LLMs.
- Content size varied slightly due to persona changes, but the differences were not too significant.
- The LLMs did not provide sufficient detail and lacked depth â€” this may be due to lower maximum token availability with increased context.
- The "Student" persona tended to explain the working in more detail, whereas the "Developer" persona generated content that was brief and primarily aimed at building awareness of the concept.
