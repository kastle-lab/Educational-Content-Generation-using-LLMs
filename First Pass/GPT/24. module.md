# Schema.org

## Content

### Introduction to Schema.org

Schema.org is a collaborative effort initiated by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Yandex to create and support a common set of schemas for structured data markup on web pages. Its purpose is to standardize the structured data that developers embed in web pages, enhancing search engines' ability to understand the content and provide richer search results.

### Goals of Schema.org

- **Interoperability**: Facilitate data sharing and interoperability across different platforms and search engines.
- **Data Enrichment**: Enhance search engine results by providing more context and meaning to the data.
- **Uniformity**: Establish a common vocabulary for webmasters and developers to describe their data.

### Basic Components of Schema.org

#### Types

Types define the kinds of items that can be described. Each type consists of a collection of properties that provide details about that type.

##### Example: Defining a Type
```jsonld
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "John Smith",
  "jobTitle": "Professor",
  "telephone": "(123) 456-7890",
  "url": "http://www.example.com"
}
```

#### Properties

Properties describe attributes related to the types. These include simple properties like `name`, or complex properties like `address` which can have their own set of attributes.

##### Example: Defining Properties
```jsonld
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "1234 Elm St",
    "addressLocality": "Somewhere",
    "postalCode": "12345"
  }
}
```

### Key Schema.org Types

#### Person
Represents an individual.
- **Properties**: `name`, `jobTitle`, `telephone`, `address`

#### Organization
Represents a company or organization.
- **Properties**: `name`, `url`, `contactPoint`, `address`

#### Event
Represents an event happening at a certain time and place.
- **Properties**: `name`, `location`, `startDate`, `endDate`

#### Product
Represents a product offered for sale.
- **Properties**: `name`, `image`, `description`, `sku`, `offers`

#### Place
Represents a physical location.
- **Properties**: `name`, `address`, `geo`, `openingHoursSpecification`

### Schema.org and Linked Data

Schema.org plays a significant role in Linked Data by providing a shared vocabulary. This enables the linking of diverse data sources into a single coherent data cloud, enhancing the web's data interoperability.

### Implementing Schema.org

Schema.org can be embedded in webpages using various syntaxes including Microdata, RDFa, and JSON-LD.

#### JSON-LD
JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) is a lightweight Linked Data format that is easy for humans to read and write, and it is simple for machines to parse and generate.

##### Example: Embedding Schema.org with JSON-LD
```jsonld
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Example Corporation",
  "url": "http://www.example.com",
  "contactPoint": [{
    "@type": "ContactPoint",
    "telephone": "+1-800-555-1212",
    "contactType": "Customer Service"
  }]
}
```

### Using Schema.org in Practice

#### Enhancing SEO

By embedding Schema.org markup, webmasters can improve their site's search engine optimization (SEO). Enhanced search results often feature rich snippets which include additional details about the content, such as reviews, prices, or events.

#### Structured Data Testing Tool

Google provides a Structured Data Testing Tool that allows developers to validate their Schema.org markup and preview how it will appear in search results.

### Advanced Concepts in Schema.org

#### Extending Schema.org

Developers can extend Schema.org to cater to specific use cases by creating custom schemas. This is usually done by defining new types and properties that are properly linked to existing Schema.org types.

#### Schema.org and RDF

Schema.org's ontology and structure align with RDF (Resource Description Framework), supporting integrations with other Semantic Web technologies. This alignment ensures that data structured with Schema.org can be used seamlessly in broader Semantic Web applications.

### Best Practices

- **Alignment**: Ensure data is accurately aligned with the correct Schema.org types and properties.
- **Context**: Always provide context using the `@context` attribute.
- **Validation**: Regularly use the Structured Data Testing Tool to validate embedded Schema.org data.
- **Update**: Keep the Schema.org markup current as the vocabulary evolves.

### Tools and Resources

#### Tools Supporting Schema.org
1. **Google Structured Data Markup Helper**: Assists in generating Schema.org markup.
2. **Schema.org Validator**: Validates the correctness of Schema.org annotations.

#### Libraries
1. **JSON-LD Processor**: Libraries for various programming languages to parse and understand JSON-LD data.
2. **RDFLib**: A Python library for working with RDF, supports Schema.org.
