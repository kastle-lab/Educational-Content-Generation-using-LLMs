### Module 13: **Open World Assumption vs Closed World Assumption**

#### Content

The concepts of the **Open World Assumption (OWA)** and the **Closed World Assumption (CWA)** are foundational to understanding various approaches to knowledge representation, databases, and reasoning systems in both computer science and artificial intelligence. These assumptions define how we treat the truth or falsity of information when that information is unknown or absent. In this module, we will explore both the Open and Closed World Assumptions in depth, compare their applications, and examine their roles in knowledge graphs and other reasoning frameworks.

#### 1. **Open World Assumption (OWA)**

The Open World Assumption (OWA) is based on the idea that the knowledge base may not have complete information about the world. In this assumption, if something is not known to be true, it is not automatically considered false. The OWA is commonly used in **knowledge representation systems** like the Semantic Web, ontologies, and knowledge graphs.

##### 1.1. **Principles of OWA**
The OWA operates under the belief that:
- Knowledge is never complete.
- The absence of information does not imply the falsity of a statement.
- New information can always be added to the knowledge base, which might change the truth value of a statement.

For instance, if a database does not contain any information on whether “Person A has visited Italy,” this lack of information does not mean that Person A has not visited Italy. It just means the system does not know.

##### 1.2. **OWA in Knowledge Graphs**
In knowledge graphs, which are designed to model real-world knowledge and its relationships, the OWA is the default assumption. This makes sense because a knowledge graph cannot be expected to know everything about the domain it represents, and new data is continually integrated. As a result, OWA allows the system to remain flexible and extendable without making unwarranted assumptions.

The OWA's flexibility makes it ideal for applications such as the **Semantic Web**, where data is decentralized, incomplete, and often evolving. For example, **OWL (Web Ontology Language)** and **RDF (Resource Description Framework)** use OWA to manage the representation of knowledge on the web.

##### 1.3. **Benefits and Limitations of OWA**
**Benefits:**
- Allows for evolving and scalable systems: New facts can be added without affecting existing knowledge.
- Realistic in open environments: It is appropriate for applications where the knowledge domain is vast and incomplete.
- Promotes interoperability: By allowing systems to integrate knowledge from diverse and potentially incomplete sources.

**Limitations:**
- Can lead to indeterminacy: Because OWA does not assume facts are false if not known to be true, reasoning systems may struggle with answering certain queries definitively.
- Inappropriate for closed domains: In applications where completeness is expected (e.g., relational databases), OWA can lead to ambiguity.

#### 2. **Closed World Assumption (CWA)**

In contrast, the Closed World Assumption (CWA) asserts that what is not currently known to be true is assumed to be false. This assumption is more restrictive and is traditionally employed in **relational databases** and systems that work in closed environments, where the system is expected to have complete information about a given domain.

##### 2.1. **Principles of CWA**
The CWA operates under the belief that:
- The knowledge base contains complete information.
- If a fact cannot be derived from the knowledge base, it is considered false.
- All relevant information is assumed to be available.

For example, in a relational database of employee records, if the database does not record that “Employee A has a driver’s license,” under the CWA, it is inferred that Employee A does not have a driver’s license.

##### 2.2. **CWA in Databases**
The CWA is widely used in **traditional databases** where the data is expected to be exhaustive for the domain being queried. For instance, in an enterprise database containing payroll information, if an employee’s salary is not found in the database, it is assumed that the employee has no salary, as the database is expected to hold all relevant information.

Relational database systems like **SQL** operate under the CWA, where any query on missing data returns a result indicating the non-existence of that data.

##### 2.3. **Benefits and Limitations of CWA**
**Benefits:**
- Enables deterministic queries: The CWA allows databases to return definite answers because any unknown fact is assumed false.
- Suitable for closed domains: Systems where all data is available and complete (e.g., enterprise systems) benefit from this assumption.

**Limitations:**
- Inflexibility in open systems: In environments where data is incomplete or can change, such as in the Semantic Web, the CWA is too rigid.
- Risk of incorrect assumptions: In cases where data is absent rather than explicitly false, CWA can lead to misleading conclusions.

#### 3. **Comparison: OWA vs. CWA**

Understanding the key differences between OWA and CWA is critical when determining which assumption to use in different applications. Here’s a comparison:

| Aspect                          | Open World Assumption (OWA)        | Closed World Assumption (CWA)     |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Knowledge Completeness**       | Assumes knowledge is incomplete    | Assumes knowledge is complete     |
| **Unknown Facts**                | Unknown facts are neither true nor false | Unknown facts are considered false |
| **Applicability**                | Suitable for open, decentralized systems (e.g., Semantic Web) | Suitable for closed systems (e.g., relational databases) |
| **Examples**                     | OWL, RDF, Semantic Web             | SQL, Relational Databases         |
| **Flexibility**                  | High: Allows for the addition of new knowledge | Low: Operates under strict assumptions about the domain |
| **Risk**                         | Indeterminacy in reasoning         | Risk of incorrect assumptions     |

##### 3.1. **When to Use OWA**
- In open environments where new data can continuously be added.
- When working with distributed knowledge systems (e.g., the Semantic Web).
- When it is preferable to avoid false negatives (i.e., assuming something is false just because it is unknown).

##### 3.2. **When to Use CWA**
- In controlled, closed environments where the system is expected to have complete knowledge of the domain.
- When using traditional databases that need deterministic answers.

#### 4. **Real-World Applications**

##### 4.1. **Semantic Web and Ontologies (OWA)**
The **Semantic Web** relies heavily on OWA due to its nature as a web of interconnected data that is constantly evolving. Systems built on technologies like **RDF** and **OWL** allow data to be linked and expanded without assuming completeness. This makes the Semantic Web robust in environments where new data is continually added.

##### 4.2. **Enterprise Databases (CWA)**
In contrast, most **enterprise databases** function under the CWA because they operate in closed, well-defined environments where all relevant data is stored. Systems such as payroll or inventory management depend on the assumption that the database contains all necessary information, making CWA the logical choice.

##### 4.3. **Hybrid Approaches**
Some systems combine both OWA and CWA depending on the context. For example, certain **AI systems** may assume a closed world for specific knowledge domains (e.g., a chess game, where all possible moves are known) but use OWA for external data (e.g., real-world knowledge updates).
