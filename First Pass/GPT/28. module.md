# SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)

## Content

### Introduction to SKOS

SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) is a W3C recommendation designed for representing semi-formal knowledge organization systems such as thesauri, classification schemes, subject heading systems, and taxonomies. It provides a model for expressing the basic structure and content of concept schemes (e.g., thesauri, classification schemes) within the framework of the Semantic Web.

SKOS is part of the W3C's Semantic Web Activity and is a cornerstone for building and sharing concept schemes used to describe the meaning of terms and relationships in a structured manner.

### Fundamental Concepts in SKOS

#### 1. Concepts and Labels

- **Concept**: The fundamental unit of thought, a mental representation of a class of items, it could be an object, an idea, or event.
  - *Example*: The concept of "Apple" may include all different types of apples, the idea of an apple, or a specific apple being referred to.

- **Labels**: Labels are human-readable strings that represent concepts.
  - **Preferred Labels** (`skos:prefLabel`): This is the string preferred by the publisher of the knowledge organization system. Each concept can only have one preferred label per language.
  - **Alternative Labels** (`skos:altLabel`): These are acceptable, alternative strings for the concept.
  - **Hidden Labels** (`skos:hiddenLabel`): These are labels that may be used for lookup purposes but are not visible to end-users.

    ```markdown
    **Example:**
    skos:Concept
      skos:prefLabel "Apple"@en.
      skos:altLabel "Malus domestica"@en.
      skos:hiddenLabel "A"@en.
    ```

#### 2. Concept Schemes

- **Concept Scheme** (`skos:ConceptScheme`): A set of concepts and the relationships between them.
  - *Example*: An agricultural thesaurus might have a concept scheme that organizes concepts related to agriculture.

    ```markdown
    **Example:**
    skos:ConceptScheme
      dc:title "Agricultural Thesaurus"@en.
    ```

#### 3. Hierarchical Relationships

- **Broader Concepts** (`skos:broader`): A more general concept.
- **Narrower Concepts** (`skos:narrower`): A more specific concept.
- **Broader Transitive** (`skos:broaderTransitive`): Useful for inferring broader relationships through transitivity.
- **Narrower Transitive** (`skos:narrowerTransitive`): Useful for inferring narrower relationships through transitivity.

    ```markdown
    **Example:**
    skos:Concept
      skos:prefLabel "Fruit"@en;
      skos:narrower <http://example.org/Concept/Apple>.
    ```

#### 4. Associative Relationships

- **Related Concepts** (`skos:related`): Useful for indicating that two concepts are inherently related but do not fall under the broader/narrower hierarchy.
  
    ```markdown
    **Example:**
    skos:Concept
      skos:prefLabel "Apple"@en;
      skos:related <http://example.org/Concept/Orchard>.
    ```

### Advanced SKOS Features

#### 1. Concept Mapping

SKOS provides properties for inter-scheme mappings which are crucial when integrating multiple concept schemes:

- **Exact Match** (`skos:exactMatch`): Indicates that two concepts are equivalent in meaning.
- **Close Match** (`skos:closeMatch`): Indicating that two concepts are sufficiently similar to be used interchangeably in some contexts.
- **Broad Match** (`skos:broadMatch`): Indicates that the referenced concept is broader in meaning.
- **Narrow Match** (`skos:narrowMatch`): Indicates that the referenced concept is narrower in meaning.
- **Related Match** (`skos:relatedMatch`): Indicates a non-hierarchical association between concepts in different schemes.

    ```markdown
    **Example:**
    skos:Concept
      skos:prefLabel "Apple"@en;
      skos:exactMatch <http://anotherexample.org/Concept/MalusDomestica>.
    ```

#### 2. Collections and Concept Groupings

- **Collection** (`skos:Collection`): This is used to group concepts without implying a broader/narrower relationship.
- **Ordered Collections** (`skos:OrderedCollection`): A sequence of concepts, often used when the order of concepts matters.

    ```markdown
    **Example:**
    skos:Collection
      skos:member <http://example.org/Concept/Apple>, <http://example.org/Concept/Orange>, <http://example.org/Concept/Banana>.
    ```

### Implementing SKOS

SKOS can be implemented using RDF, with the concepts, relationships, and labels encoded in RDF triples. Various tools support SKOS, including Protégé, TopBraid Composer, and the SKOS API. A typical application might involve creating a knowledge base containing a thesaurus of concepts used in a specific domain.

### Practical Applications of SKOS

1. **Digital Libraries and Archives**: SKOS is used for creating and managing thesauri and taxonomies to improve the search and retrieval of information.
2. **Enterprise Knowledge Management**: Supports semantic search, data integration, and knowledge sharing across organizations.
3. **Linked Data Projects**: SKOS facilitates linking and integrating vocabularies in different datasets, enhancing data interoperability.
