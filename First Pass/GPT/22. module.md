# Manchester Syntax

## Content

### Introduction to Manchester Syntax

Manchester Syntax is a user-friendly syntax for OWL that provides a clear, human-readable way of writing OWL ontologies. It was designed to be more intuitive and easier to read and write than other OWL syntaxes, such as RDF/XML. This syntax is especially useful for ontology creators and users who are not familiar with the more formal, structured syntax like RDF/XML, yet still need to utilize the full expressive power of OWL.

### Basics of Manchester Syntax

#### Class Expressions

Class expressions play a pivotal role in the Manchester Syntax, allowing for the description of classes and how they relate to one another. Basic components include class hierarchies, intersections, unions, and complements.

##### Example: Defining a Class
```manchester-syntax
Class: Person
```

#### Subclass Expressions

Subclass expressions define hierarchical relationships between classes.

##### Example: Defining a Subclass
```manchester-syntax
Class: Man
    SubClassOf: Person
```

#### Logical Operators

Manchester Syntax leverages logical operators to build complex class expressions.

##### Intersection (AND)
```manchester-syntax
Class: Man
    EquivalentTo: Person and Male
```

##### Union (OR)
```manchester-syntax
Class: Parent
    EquivalentTo: Mother or Father
```

##### Complement (NOT)
```manchester-syntax
Class: NonParent
    EquivalentTo: Person and not Parent
```

### Property Expressions

Property expressions in Manchester Syntax define relationships between individuals or between individuals and data values.

#### Object Properties
Object properties connect pairs of individuals.

##### Example: Defining an Object Property
```manchester-syntax
ObjectProperty: hasChild
    Domain: Person
    Range: Person
```

#### Data Properties
Data properties connect individuals to data values.

##### Example: Defining a Data Property
```manchester-syntax
DataProperty: hasAge
    Domain: Person
    Range: integer
```

### Property Characteristics

Object and data properties can have additional characteristics like transitivity, symmetry, and functionality.

#### Functional Property
A functional property asserts that an individual is related to at most one other individual or data value.

##### Example: Defining a Functional Property
```manchester-syntax
ObjectProperty: hasHusband
    Characteristics: Functional
```

#### Inverse Property
Inverse properties express that if an individual `x` is related to an individual `y` by a property `P`, then `y` is related to `x` by the inverse of `P`.

##### Example: Defining an Inverse Property
```manchester-syntax
ObjectProperty: hasParent
    InverseOf: hasChild
```

### Annotations and Axioms

#### Annotations
Annotations provide metadata about classes, properties, and individuals. They can include comments, labels, and other metadata.

##### Example: Adding Annotations
```manchester-syntax
Class: Person
    Annotations: rdfs:comment "Represents all humans"
```

#### Disjoint Classes
Disjoint classes are classes that have no individuals in common.

##### Example: Defining Disjoint Classes
```manchester-syntax
Class: Male
    DisjointWith: Female
```

### Advanced Features

#### Restriction Expressions

Restrictions limit the individuals that can belong to a class based on property values.

##### Some Values From (Existential Quantification)
```manchester-syntax
Class: Parent
    EquivalentTo: Person
        and (hasChild some Person)
```

##### All Values From (Universal Quantification)
```manchester-syntax
Class: Vegetarian
    EquivalentTo: Person
        and (eats only Plant)
```

#### Cardinality Restrictions
Cardinality restrictions specify the number of times an individual can participate in a relationship.

##### Exact Cardinality
```manchester-syntax
Class: Human
    EquivalentTo: Person
        and (hasHeart exactly 1 Heart)
```

##### Minimum and Maximum Cardinality
```manchester-syntax
Class: Polygamist
    EquivalentTo: Person
        and (hasSpouse min 2 Person)
```

### Tools Supporting Manchester Syntax

#### Protégé
Protégé is a widely-used ontology editor that supports Manchester Syntax. It provides an environment for the development, visualization, and manipulation of ontologies, assisting users in building ontologies using this intuitive syntax.

#### OWL API
The OWL API is a Java API used to create, read, write, and manipulate OWL ontologies. It supports Manchester Syntax, among other syntaxes, facilitating programmatic ontology management.
