# SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language)

## Content

### Introduction to SHACL

The Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is a W3C standard designed to validate RDF graphs against a set of conditions known as shapes. SHACL enables users to define rules and constraints that RDF data must comply with, making it a vital technology for ensuring data quality and consistency in the Semantic Web.

### Basic Concepts in SHACL

#### Shapes

Shapes are the core component in SHACL. A shape describes the constraints that the RDF nodes must satisfy. SHACL shapes are expressed as RDF graphs themselves, making them compatible with other RDF-based infrastructure.

- **Target Nodes**: Nodes in the RDF graph that the shape applies to.
- **Properties**: Constraints on the properties of target nodes.
- **Classes**: Constraints on the classes of target nodes.

#### Example: Defining a Simple Shape
```turtle
ex:PersonShape
    a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass ex:Person ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path ex:age ;
        sh:datatype xsd:integer ;
        sh:minInclusive 0 ;
    ] .
```
In the above example, `ex:PersonShape` targets all instances of `ex:Person` and applies constraints to the `ex:age` property. The `ex:age` property must be an integer and must be at least 0.

### Components of SHACL

#### Property Shapes

Property shapes define constraints on specific properties of nodes. They allow specifying requirements like the datatype, cardinality, and value range of properties.

##### Examples:

1. **Node Kind Constrains**
   ```turtle
   ex:PersonShape
       a sh:NodeShape ;
       sh:targetClass ex:Person ;
       sh:property [
           sh:path ex: knows ;
           sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;
       ] .
   ```

2. **String-based Constraints**
   ```turtle
   ex:PersonShape
       a sh:NodeShape ;
       sh:targetClass ex:Person ;
       sh:property [
           sh:path ex:name ;
           sh:datatype xsd:string ;
           sh:minLength 1 ;
           sh:maxLength 50 ;
       ] .
   ```

#### Node Shapes

Node shapes describe constraints on a node as a whole, taking into account multiple properties and their interrelationships.

##### Example: Age Range Constraint
```turtle
ex:AdultShape
    a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass ex:Person ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path ex:age ;
        sh:minInclusive 18 ;
    ] .
```

### SHACL Expressions and Logical Constraints

#### SHACL Expressions

SHACL supports expressions to create complex constraints.

##### Example: Logical OR
```turtle
ex:PersonShape
    a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass ex:Person ;
    sh:or (
        [ sh:property [ sh:path ex:homePage ; sh:datatype xsd:anyURI ] ]
        [ sh:property [ sh:path ex:email ; sh:datatype xsd:string ] ]
    ) .
```

#### Logical Constraints
SHACL allows combining constraints using logical operators like `sh:or`, `sh:and`, `sh:not`, ensuring flexible validation rules.

##### Example: Complement
```turtle
ex:PersonShape
    a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass ex:Person ;
    sh:not [
        sh:property [
            sh:path ex:age ;
            sh:maxInclusive 17 ;
        ]
    ] .
```

### Advanced Concepts in SHACL

#### Constraints on Nested Nodes

SHACL permits specifying constraints not only on the target nodes but also on nested nodes, enforcing complex integrity constraints on RDF graphs.

##### Example: Nested Property Shape
```turtle
ex:AddressShape
    a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path ex:street ;
        sh:datatype xsd:string ;
        sh:minLength 1 ;
    ] ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path ex:city ;
        sh:datatype xsd:string ;
        sh:minLength 1 ;
    ] ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path ex:postalCode ;
        sh:datatype xsd:string ;
        sh:minLength 5 ;
        sh:maxLength 10 ;
    ] .
```

#### Interaction with RDF Data

SHACL shapes operate on RDF data graphs, ensuring that data adheres to the defined constraints. This interaction is crucial for data validation, quality assurance, and compliance with predefined schemas.

##### Example: Full Shape Definition
```turtle
ex:PersonWithContactShape
    a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass ex:Person ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path ex:address ;
        sh:node ex: AddressShape ;
    ] ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path ex:contactInfo ;
        sh:or (
            [ sh:property [ sh:path ex:email ; sh:datatype xsd:string ] ]
            [ sh:property [ sh:path ex:phone ; sh:datatype xsd:string ] ]
        ) ;
    ] .
```

### Best Practices in Using SHACL

- **Reusability**: Define reusable shapes for consistency and maintainability.
- **Documentation**: Annotate shapes with comments and descriptions for clarity.
- **Validation**: Regularly validate RDF data against SHACL shapes to maintain data quality.

### Tools and Libraries Supporting SHACL

#### SHACL Validators
1. **TopBraid SHACL API**: An API for processing and validating SHACL shapes.
2. **PySHACL**: A Python library for SHACL validation.

#### Integration with Existing Tools
1. **Protégé**: An ontology editor that supports SHACL for adding constraints and validating data.
2. **Apache Jena**: A framework that includes SHACL validation support.
