# Survey of Reasoners

## Content

### Introduction
Reasoning is a fundamental aspect of knowledge representation and semantic web technologies. Reasoners help infer logical consequences from a set of asserted facts or axioms. They are an integral component in systems that handle ontologies, rules, and other semantic web technologies, enabling automatic knowledge inference.

### 1. What are Reasoners?
#### Definition
Reasoners are software tools or algorithms that perform logical reasoning over knowledge bases. They process formal ontologies, represented in languages such as OWL (Web Ontology Language), to infer implicit knowledge from explicitly stated facts using formal logic techniques.

#### Purpose
- Validate the internal consistency of ontologies.
- Deduce new knowledge from existing data.
- Support ontology alignment and integration tasks.
- Empower intelligent agents and systems with decision-making capabilities.

### 2. Types of Reasoners
#### Rule-based Reasoners
Rule-based reasoners apply forward or backward chaining rules. They are often used in expert systems and within certain semantic web applications that require rule-based logic.
- **Forward Chaining:** Starts with known facts and applies rules to infer new facts.
- **Backward Chaining:** Begins with a goal and works backward to find supporting facts.

#### Description Logic Reasoners
These reasoners are based on description logics, a family of formal knowledge representation languages.
- **Examples:** Pellet, Fact++, HermiT

### 3. Key Concepts in Reasoning
#### Soundness and Completeness
- **Soundness:** All inferences made by the reasoner are logically valid.
- **Completeness:** The reasoner can, given enough time, infer all facts that are true within the given knowledge base.

#### Complexity
Reasoning complexity is an important factor that affects the feasibility of using a reasoner in practice.
- **Time Complexity:** The amount of time required for reasoning operations.
- **Space Complexity:** The amount of memory required during reasoning operations.

### 4. Popular Reasoners
#### Pellet
Pellet is an OWL 2 reasoner based on description logic and supports a wide range of inference tasks such as consistency checking, classification, and realization.

#### HermiT
HermiT is a highly efficient reasoner for OWL ontologies. It is known for using hypertableau calculus and offers features like conjunctive query answering.

#### Fact++
Fact++ is a reasoner specifically optimized for expressive description logics. It supports OWL DL and its variants and is known for high performance in complex reasoning tasks.

### 5. Applications of Reasoners
- **Ontology Engineering:** Helping ensure the logical consistency of ontologies.
- **Data Integration:** Inferring implicit relationships and constraints, aiding in data interlinking.
- **Semantic Web Services:** Used in systems that provide advanced querying and logical operations over semantic data.
- **Intelligent Systems:** Supporting autonomous decision-making based on inferred knowledge.

### 6. Emerging Trends and Technologies
Reasoning technology continues to evolve, with emerging trends enhancing efficiency and scalability.
- **Parallel and Distributed Reasoning:** Leveraging parallel computing and cloud environments to handle large-scale ontologies.
- **Approximate Reasoning:** Providing faster, although possibly incomplete, reasoning results for time-sensitive applications.
- **Hybrid Reasoners:** Combining different reasoning paradigms (e.g., combining rule-based and description logic reasoning) to leverage their respective strengths.
