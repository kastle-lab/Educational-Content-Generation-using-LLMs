# Survey of Documentation Practices

## Content

### Introduction
In the realm of knowledge engineering and semantic web technologies, documentation practices are crucial to ensure clarity, maintainability, and usability of ontology and data models. Proper documentation aids in the understanding and adoption of knowledge graphs (KGs) by providing clear guidelines, definitions, and usage instructions. This module will explore various documentation practices and tools commonly employed in the field.

### Importance of Documentation

1. **Facilitates Understanding**
   - Documentation serves as a narrative that explains the components, relationships, and intent of the knowledge graph.
   - It provides context to users, reducing the cognitive load required to interpret complex ontological structures.

2. **Improves Maintainability**
   - Well-documented KGs are easier to maintain and update.
   - Documentation helps track changes, ensuring continuity and consistency over time.

3. **Enhances Collaboration**
   - Clear documentation enables seamless collaboration among multidisciplinary teams.
   - It ensures all stakeholders, from developers to domain experts, have a shared understanding of the KG.

### Documentation Techniques

1. **Formal Documentation**
   - Employs standardized formats and structures to describe ontologies and KGs.
   - Examples include machine-readable documents like OWL or RDF files enhanced with human-readable annotations.

2. **Descriptive Annotations**
   - Utilize comment properties like `rdfs:comment` and `dc:description` to add explanations directly within the ontology.
   - This method embeds the documentation within the ontology files, making it accessible to users and machines alike.

3. **Auto-Generated Documentation**
   - Tools such as WIDOCO (Wizard for Documenting Ontologies) can generate comprehensive documentation from OWL files.
   - These tools typically create HTML pages with detailed descriptions of classes, properties, and individuals.

### Best Practices for Documentation

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**
   - Ensure that documentation is clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary jargon.
   - Provide examples to illustrate complex concepts.

2. **Consistency**
   - Maintain a consistent style and structure throughout the documentation.
   - Use standard terminologies and conventions to avoid confusion.

3. **Accessibility**
   - Make documentation easily accessible to all stakeholders.
   - Consider using web-based platforms or repositories with search and navigation features. 

### Tools for Documenting Knowledge Graphs

1. **WIDOCO (Wizard for Documenting Ontologies)**
   - A tool designed to generate ontology documentation following best practices.
   - Outputs include HTML documents with sections for ontology metadata, class hierarchy, properties, and annotations.
   - [WIDOCO Documentation](https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco)

2. **Parrot**
   - A tool that helps in documenting and visualizing ontologies.
   - Allows users to add rich documentation to ontologies and generate interactive reports.
   - [Parrot Documentation](https://protegeproject.github.io/parrot/)

3. **d2rq**
   - Provides means of documenting RDF databases including mapping and publishing.
   - Useful in making RDB-to-RDF mapping comprehensible through generated documentation.
   - [d2rq Documentation](http://d2rq.org/)

### Case Studies

1. **Documenting Industry Ontologies**
   - Explore how different industries employ ontology documentation practices.
   - Examples include medical, financial, and geospatial ontologies, showcasing domain-specific documentation requirements.

2. **Open Source Ontology Documentation**
   - Study community-driven ontologies like FOAF (Friend of a Friend) and how they document schemas for wider adoption and collaboration.
   - Investigate the RDF Schema documentation of FOAF as a model [FOAF RDF Schema Documentation](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/)
