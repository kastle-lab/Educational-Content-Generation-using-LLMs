### Module 6: **Propositional Logic**

#### **Content**

Propositional Logic, often referred to as propositional calculus or sentential logic, is a branch of logic that deals with propositions and their relationships through logical connectives. It forms the foundational basis of reasoning in mathematics, computer science, and philosophy. In this module, we will explore the core concepts of propositional logic, focusing on its syntax, semantics, and various properties, which are crucial for understanding more advanced forms of logic used in knowledge representation and reasoning.

##### **1. Introduction to Propositional Logic**
Propositional logic is a formal system where formulas represent statements (propositions) that can either be true or false. It focuses on the manipulation and evaluation of these propositions using logical operators, enabling structured reasoning and deduction.

In propositional logic:
- **Proposition**: A declarative sentence that is either true (T) or false (F). For example, "The sky is blue" is a proposition, and its truth value can be determined.
- **Truth Values**: The two possible values a proposition can take—true (T) or false (F).
- **Logical Connectives**: Symbols that connect propositions to form more complex expressions. Common logical connectives include:
  - **Negation (¬)**: "Not", which inverts the truth value of a proposition.
  - **Conjunction (∧)**: "And", true if both propositions are true.
  - **Disjunction (∨)**: "Or", true if at least one proposition is true.
  - **Implication (→)**: "If... then", true if the first proposition implies the second.
  - **Biconditional (↔)**: "If and only if", true when both propositions have the same truth value.

##### **2. Syntax of Propositional Logic**
The syntax of propositional logic refers to the formal rules that define how propositions and connectives can be combined to form valid logical expressions.

- **Atomic Propositions**: The most basic units, represented by letters such as \( P \), \( Q \), and \( R \), which are assigned truth values.
- **Compound Propositions**: Created by combining atomic propositions using logical connectives. For instance, \( P \land Q \) is a compound proposition that is true if both \( P \) and \( Q \) are true.
- **Parentheses**: Used to clarify the grouping of propositions, ensuring the correct order of evaluation in compound statements. For example, \( (P \lor Q) \land R \) means \( P \lor Q \) is evaluated first, then the result is combined with \( R \).

##### **3. Semantics of Propositional Logic**
Semantics in propositional logic is concerned with the meaning of propositions and how their truth values are determined.

- **Truth Tables**: A key tool used to determine the truth value of a compound proposition based on the truth values of its components. Each row of a truth table corresponds to a possible combination of truth values for the atomic propositions.
  - Example: For the expression \( P \land Q \), the truth table is as follows:

    | \( P \) | \( Q \) | \( P \land Q \) |
    |--------|--------|-----------------|
    | T      | T      | T               |
    | T      | F      | F               |
    | F      | T      | F               |
    | F      | F      | F               |

  - Similarly, truth tables can be constructed for other logical connectives such as \( \lor \), \( \rightarrow \), and \( \neg \).

- **Tautology, Contradiction, and Contingency**:
  - A **tautology** is a proposition that is always true regardless of the truth values of its components (e.g., \( P \lor \neg P \)).
  - A **contradiction** is a proposition that is always false (e.g., \( P \land \neg P \)).
  - A **contingency** is a proposition that can be either true or false depending on the truth values of its components (e.g., \( P \land Q \)).

##### **4. Logical Equivalence and Implication**
Logical equivalence and implication are essential concepts in propositional logic, allowing for the transformation and simplification of logical expressions.

- **Logical Equivalence**: Two propositions are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value in every possible scenario. For example, \( P \rightarrow Q \) is logically equivalent to \( \neg P \lor Q \). Equivalences can be proven using truth tables or by applying logical laws such as De Morgan's laws:
  - \( \neg (P \land Q) \equiv \neg P \lor \neg Q \)
  - \( \neg (P \lor Q) \equiv \neg P \land \neg Q \)

- **Implication**: A proposition of the form \( P \rightarrow Q \) states that if \( P \) is true, then \( Q \) must also be true. Importantly, if \( P \) is false, the implication is always true, regardless of \( Q \)'s truth value. This sometimes leads to counterintuitive results, but it is consistent within the formal system.

##### **5. Inference Rules and Proof Systems**
Inference rules are the principles that guide the derivation of new propositions from given ones. These rules are foundational in formal proofs, where a conclusion is reached based on premises.

- **Modus Ponens**: If \( P \rightarrow Q \) and \( P \) are both true, then \( Q \) must be true.
- **Modus Tollens**: If \( P \rightarrow Q \) is true and \( Q \) is false, then \( P \) must also be false.
- **Disjunction Elimination**: If \( P \lor Q \) is true and \( \neg P \) is true, then \( Q \) must be true.

These inference rules, among others, form the basis for constructing formal proofs in propositional logic.

##### **6. Applications of Propositional Logic**
Propositional logic plays a crucial role in various fields:

- **Mathematics**: Used for theorem proving and defining the logical foundation of mathematical statements.
- **Computer Science**: Essential in algorithms, programming language design, and verification. Boolean logic, a subset of propositional logic, is fundamental in digital circuit design.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: In AI, propositional logic is applied in rule-based systems and reasoning engines. It is also used to represent knowledge in simplified environments.

##### **7. Limitations of Propositional Logic**
While propositional logic is powerful, it has its limitations. It cannot express relationships between objects, a task reserved for more advanced forms of logic, such as **predicate logic**. For instance, while propositional logic can represent simple facts like "John is a student" (P), it cannot express more complex statements like "All students are enrolled in a course."
