Here's a detailed educational curriculum for the module topic "RDF" based on the structural data provided:

# RDF (Resource Description Framework)

## Content

### 1. Introduction to RDF

Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. It forms the foundation of the Semantic Web and Linked Data concepts. RDF extends the linking structure of the Web by using URIs to name the relationship between things as well as the two ends of the link (this is usually referred to as a "triple"). This linking structure forms a directed, labeled graph, where the edges represent the named link between two resources, represented by the graph nodes.

#### 1.1 Core Concepts

- **Subject**: The entity being described
- **Predicate**: The property or relationship
- **Object**: The value of the property or the other entity involved in the relationship

These three parts together form an RDF statement, also known as a triple.

### 2. RDF Data Model

The RDF data model is based on making statements about resources in the form of subject-predicate-object expressions, called triples. 

#### 2.1 Resources

In RDF, a resource can be anything that is identifiable by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). This includes:

- Web pages
- Individual elements of an XML document
- Digital or physical objects
- Abstract concepts

#### 2.2 Properties

Properties in RDF are special kinds of resources that describe relations between resources. They are also identified by URIs.

#### 2.3 Statements

An RDF statement (or triple) consists of:

- A subject (a resource)
- A predicate (a property)
- An object (a resource or a literal value)

### 3. RDF Syntax

RDF can be expressed in various formats. The most common are:

#### 3.1 RDF/XML

XML-based syntax, which was the first standard format for serializing RDF.

Example:
```xml
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
         xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.example.org/book/1234">
    <dc:title>The Example Book</dc:title>
    <dc:creator>John Doe</dc:creator>
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
```

#### 3.2 Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language)

A more compact and readable format.

Example:
```turtle
@prefix dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/> .

<http://www.example.org/book/1234>
    dc:title "The Example Book" ;
    dc:creator "John Doe" .
```

#### 3.3 N-Triples

A line-based, plain text format for encoding RDF graphs.

Example:
```
<http://www.example.org/book/1234> <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title> "The Example Book" .
<http://www.example.org/book/1234> <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/creator> "John Doe" .
```

### 4. RDF Schema (RDFS)

RDF Schema provides a data-modeling vocabulary for RDF data. It extends RDF to include:

- Classes
- Subclasses
- Properties
- Subproperties
- Domain and range restrictions

RDFS allows for the definition of taxonomies and ontologies.

### 5. Blank Nodes

Blank nodes (or anonymous resources) are nodes in an RDF graph that are not identified by a URI. They are used to describe resources that don't need a separate identifier.

### 6. Reification

Reification in RDF is the process of making statements about other statements, treating an RDF statement as a resource about which additional statements can be made.

### 7. RDF Datasets

An RDF dataset is a collection of RDF graphs. It consists of:

- One default graph (which may be empty)
- Zero or more named graphs (pairs of IRIs and RDF graphs)
