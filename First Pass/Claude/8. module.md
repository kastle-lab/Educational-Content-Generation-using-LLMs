# Predicate Logic

## Content

### 1. Introduction to Predicate Logic

Predicate logic, also known as first-order logic or quantificational logic, is a formal system for reasoning that extends propositional logic by introducing quantifiers and predicates. This powerful logical framework allows for more nuanced and expressive representations of statements and arguments than propositional logic.

#### 1.1 Basic Components of Predicate Logic

- **Predicates**: Expressions that describe properties or relations of objects.
- **Variables**: Symbols that represent individual objects within a domain.
- **Quantifiers**: Operators that specify the quantity of individuals in the domain for which a given predicate holds.
- **Constants**: Specific named objects within the domain.
- **Functions**: Mappings from objects to objects within the domain.

### 2. Predicates and Their Structure

Predicates form the backbone of predicate logic, allowing us to express properties of objects and relationships between them.

#### 2.1 Predicate Symbols and Arity

Predicates are typically represented by uppercase letters (e.g., P, Q, R) and can take any number of arguments. The number of arguments a predicate takes is called its arity.

Example:
- P(x): "x is a person" (unary predicate)
- L(x, y): "x loves y" (binary predicate)
- B(x, y, z): "x is between y and z" (ternary predicate)

#### 2.2 Well-Formed Formulas (WFFs)

Predicate logic has strict rules for constructing valid expressions, known as well-formed formulas (WFFs). These rules ensure that the logical statements are syntactically correct and meaningful.

### 3. Quantifiers in Predicate Logic

Quantifiers are powerful tools that allow us to make statements about entire collections of objects.

#### 3.1 Universal Quantifier (∀)

The universal quantifier, symbolized by ∀, is read as "for all" or "for every." It indicates that a statement holds true for every object in the domain.

Example: ∀x P(x) - "For all x, P(x) is true"

#### 3.2 Existential Quantifier (∃)

The existential quantifier, symbolized by ∃, is read as "there exists" or "for some." It indicates that a statement holds true for at least one object in the domain.

Example: ∃x P(x) - "There exists an x such that P(x) is true"

#### 3.3 Nested Quantifiers and Scope

Quantifiers can be nested, leading to more complex statements. The order of quantifiers is crucial, as it affects the meaning of the statement.

Example: ∀x ∃y L(x, y) - "For every person x, there exists someone y whom x loves"

### 4. Semantics of Predicate Logic

Understanding the meaning and interpretation of predicate logic statements is crucial for reasoning and drawing conclusions.

#### 4.1 Interpretations and Models

An interpretation assigns meaning to the symbols in a predicate logic formula by specifying a domain of discourse and defining how predicates, constants, and functions relate to that domain.

#### 4.2 Truth Values and Satisfaction

The truth value of a predicate logic formula depends on its interpretation. A formula is satisfied by an interpretation if it is true under that interpretation.

### 5. Inference Rules and Proof Techniques

Predicate logic provides a formal system for deriving new truths from existing ones through logical inference.

#### 5.1 Natural Deduction

Natural deduction is a system of proof that uses a set of inference rules to derive conclusions from premises. Key rules include:

- Universal Instantiation (UI)
- Existential Generalization (EG)
- Universal Generalization (UG)
- Existential Instantiation (EI)

#### 5.2 Resolution

Resolution is a powerful inference rule used in automated theorem proving. It involves deriving a new clause from two existing clauses that contain complementary literals.

### 6. Applications of Predicate Logic

Predicate logic finds applications in various fields due to its expressive power and formal reasoning capabilities.
