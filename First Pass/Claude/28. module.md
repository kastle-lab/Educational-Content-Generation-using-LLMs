# SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)

## Content

### 1. Introduction to SKOS

SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) is a W3C recommendation designed to support the use of knowledge organization systems (KOS) such as thesauri, classification schemes, subject heading lists, and taxonomies within the framework of the Semantic Web. SKOS provides a standard way to represent knowledge organization systems using the Resource Description Framework (RDF).

#### 1.1 Historical Context

SKOS emerged from the SWAD-Europe project, which ran from May 2002 to October 2004. The need for a common RDF vocabulary for thesauri and related systems became apparent, leading to the development of SKOS Core as a draft specification. In 2005, SKOS Core became a W3C Working Draft, eventually evolving into the SKOS recommendation in 2009.

#### 1.2 Purpose and Significance

The primary purpose of SKOS is to enable easy publication and use of concept schemes as linked data. It bridges the gap between complex knowledge organization systems used in libraries, museums, and other information management contexts and the linked data world of the Semantic Web. This standardization facilitates interoperability and data exchange between different systems and domains.

### 2. SKOS Data Model

The SKOS data model revolves around the notion of concepts, which are the fundamental units of thought in knowledge organization systems.

#### 2.1 Core Classes

- skos:Concept: Represents a unit of thought (an idea, meaning, or category of objects and events)
- skos:ConceptScheme: A set of concepts, optionally including statements about semantic relationships between those concepts
- skos:Collection: A labeled and/or ordered group of SKOS concepts

#### 2.2 Lexical Labels

SKOS provides properties for assigning lexical labels to conceptual resources:

- skos:prefLabel: The preferred lexical label for a resource
- skos:altLabel: Alternative (non-preferred) lexical labels
- skos:hiddenLabel: Labels for text-based indexing, not visible to users

#### 2.3 Semantic Relations

SKOS defines properties to represent semantic relationships between concepts:

- skos:broader / skos:narrower: Hierarchical relations
- skos:related: Associative relations

#### 2.4 Documentation Properties

For adding notes and documentation:

- skos:note: General documentation property
- skos:definition, skos:example, skos:historyNote, skos:editorialNote, skos:changeNote, skos:scopeNote: Specific types of notes

### 3. SKOS in Practice

#### 3.1 Creating SKOS Vocabularies

To create a SKOS vocabulary:

1. Define the concept scheme
2. Create concepts and assign them to the scheme
3. Add lexical labels to concepts
4. Establish semantic relationships between concepts
5. Add documentation and notes as needed

Example (in Turtle format):

```turtle
@prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> .
@prefix ex: <http://example.com/> .

ex:MyScheme a skos:ConceptScheme ;
    skos:prefLabel "My Concept Scheme"@en .

ex:Concept1 a skos:Concept ;
    skos:inScheme ex:MyScheme ;
    skos:prefLabel "First Concept"@en ;
    skos:altLabel "Initial Concept"@en ;
    skos:broader ex:Concept2 ;
    skos:definition "This is the definition of the first concept."@en .

ex:Concept2 a skos:Concept ;
    skos:inScheme ex:MyScheme ;
    skos:prefLabel "Second Concept"@en ;
    skos:narrower ex:Concept1 .
```

#### 3.2 SKOS and Linked Data

SKOS vocabularies can be published as linked data, enabling:

- Integration with other RDF-based data
- Cross-domain concept mapping
- Enhanced discoverability and reusability of knowledge organization systems

#### 3.3 SKOS Extensions

SKOS can be extended to meet specific needs:

- ISO
