# Survey of Reasoners

## Content

### 1. Introduction to Reasoning in Knowledge Graphs

Reasoning is a fundamental aspect of knowledge graphs and semantic web technologies. It allows us to infer new knowledge from existing data, validate consistency, and draw logical conclusions. In the context of knowledge graphs, reasoners play a crucial role in enhancing the utility and intelligence of these systems.

### 2. Types of Reasoners

#### 2.1 Description Logic Reasoners

Description Logic (DL) reasoners are designed to work with OWL ontologies. They perform various reasoning tasks such as:

- Consistency checking: Ensuring that the ontology does not contain contradictory information.
- Concept satisfiability: Determining whether a class can have instances.
- Classification: Computing the subsumption hierarchy of classes.
- Realization: Finding the most specific classes that an individual belongs to.

Examples of DL reasoners include HermiT, FaCT++, and Pellet.

#### 2.2 Rule-based Reasoners

Rule-based reasoners use if-then statements to infer new knowledge. They are particularly useful for expressing domain-specific rules and can work with standards like SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language).

Examples include Drools and Jess.

#### 2.3 Datalog Reasoners

Datalog reasoners are based on a subset of first-order logic and are particularly efficient for handling large datasets. They are often used in database systems and can perform recursive queries.

Examples include RDFox and LogicBlox.

### 3. Reasoning Techniques

#### 3.1 Tableau-based Reasoning

Tableau algorithms work by attempting to construct a model that satisfies the logical statements in the ontology. They are complete but can be computationally expensive for large ontologies.

#### 3.2 Resolution-based Reasoning

Resolution is a rule of inference that produces a new clause from two existing clauses. It's the basis for many automated theorem-proving systems.

#### 3.3 Consequence-based Reasoning

This technique aims to compute all logical consequences of a given set of axioms. It's particularly efficient for Horn-like description logics.

### 4. Complexity and Performance

The complexity of reasoning tasks varies depending on the expressivity of the logic used. For instance:

- OWL 2 DL: NEXPTIME-complete
- OWL 2 EL: PTIME-complete
- OWL 2 QL: NLOGSPACE-complete
- OWL 2 RL: PTIME-complete

Reasoners employ various optimization techniques to improve performance, such as:

- Modularization: Breaking down large ontologies into smaller, manageable modules.
- Incremental reasoning: Only recomputing inferences affected by changes.
- Parallel processing: Utilizing multi-core processors for faster computation.
