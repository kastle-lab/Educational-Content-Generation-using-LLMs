### Introduction to Propositional Logic

Propositional logic, also known as sentential logic or statement logic, is a fundamental branch of formal logic that deals with propositions and their relationships. It forms the basis for more complex logical systems and is essential in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and philosophy.

In propositional logic, we work with simple declarative statements that can be either true or false, but not both. These statements are called propositions or atomic propositions. We then use logical connectives to combine these simple propositions into more complex compound propositions.

### Key Components of Propositional Logic

#### 1. Propositions

A proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true or false. For example:

- "The sky is blue" (true)
- "Paris is the capital of Italy" (false)
- "2 + 2 = 4" (true)

Propositions are typically represented by lowercase letters (p, q, r, etc.) in logical expressions.

#### 2. Logical Connectives

Logical connectives are symbols or words used to combine simple propositions into compound propositions. The main logical connectives in propositional logic are:

- Negation (¬): "not"
- Conjunction (∧): "and"
- Disjunction (∨): "or"
- Implication (→): "if...then"
- Biconditional (↔): "if and only if"

### Truth Tables

Truth tables are a fundamental tool in propositional logic used to determine the truth value of compound propositions based on the truth values of their constituent simple propositions. They systematically list all possible combinations of truth values for the simple propositions and show the resulting truth value of the compound proposition.

#### Example: Conjunction Truth Table

| p | q | p ∧ q |
|---|---|-------|
| T | T |   T   |
| T | F |   F   |
| F | T |   F   |
| F | F |   F   |

This truth table shows that a conjunction (p ∧ q) is true only when both p and q are true.

### Logical Equivalence and Tautologies

Two propositional formulas are considered logically equivalent if they have the same truth value for all possible assignments of truth values to their atomic propositions. A tautology is a propositional formula that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its atomic propositions.

#### Example of Logical Equivalence:

The formulas (p → q) and (¬p ∨ q) are logically equivalent. This can be verified using truth tables or through logical reasoning.

#### Example of a Tautology:

The law of excluded middle, p ∨ ¬p, is a tautology. It states that either a proposition is true, or its negation is true.

### Inference Rules and Argument Forms

Propositional logic provides a framework for evaluating the validity of arguments. Some common inference rules include:

1. Modus Ponens: If p → q is true, and p is true, then q must be true.
2. Modus Tollens: If p → q is true, and q is false, then p must be false.
3. Hypothetical Syllogism: If p → q is true, and q → r is true, then p → r must be true.

These rules allow us to construct valid arguments and derive new truths from existing ones.

### Applications of Propositional Logic

Propositional logic has numerous applications across various fields:

1. Computer Science: Boolean algebra, which is closely related to propositional logic, is fundamental to digital circuit design and programming.

2. Mathematics: Propositional logic provides a foundation for more advanced logical systems used in mathematical proofs and set theory.

3. Artificial Intelligence: Logical reasoning based on propositional logic is used in expert systems and automated theorem proving.

4. Philosophy: Propositional logic is used to analyze and evaluate arguments in philosophical discourse.

5. Natural Language Processing: Understanding the logical structure of sentences helps in developing more sophisticated language processing algorithms.

### Limitations of Propositional Logic

While propositional logic is powerful, it has some limitations:

1. It cannot represent the internal structure of propositions. For example, it treats "All cats are mammals" as a single proposition
