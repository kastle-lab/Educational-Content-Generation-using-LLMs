# SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language)

## Content

### 1. Introduction to SHACL

SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is a W3C recommendation designed to validate RDF graphs against a set of conditions. It provides a powerful mechanism for describing and constraining the contents and structure of RDF data. SHACL allows data practitioners to define shapes, which are collections of constraints that can be used to validate RDF nodes in a data graph.

#### 1.1 Purpose and Importance

- Data Validation: SHACL enables robust validation of RDF data, ensuring data quality and consistency.
- Schema Definition: It provides a way to define the expected structure of RDF data.
- Interoperability: SHACL promotes data interoperability by allowing clear definitions of data shapes across different systems.

#### 1.2 Historical Context

SHACL was developed as a response to the limitations of existing RDF validation technologies. It builds upon and improves concepts from earlier approaches like ShEx (Shape Expressions) and Dublin Core Application Profiles.

### 2. Core Concepts of SHACL

#### 2.1 Shapes

Shapes are the fundamental building blocks of SHACL. They define a set of constraints that apply to a specific set of nodes in the data graph.

- Node Shapes: Define constraints that apply to a particular node.
- Property Shapes: Define constraints on the values of a particular property.

#### 2.2 Targets

Targets specify which nodes in the data graph should be validated against a particular shape.

- Target Types:
  - Class-based targets
  - Node-based targets
  - Subject-of targets
  - Object-of targets

#### 2.3 Constraints

Constraints are the actual rules that are applied to validate the data. SHACL provides a wide range of built-in constraint components.

- Cardinality Constraints: e.g., sh:minCount, sh:maxCount
- Value Type Constraints: e.g., sh:datatype, sh:class
- Value Range Constraints: e.g., sh:minInclusive, sh:maxExclusive
- String-based Constraints: e.g., sh:pattern, sh:languageIn
- Property Pair Constraints: e.g., sh:equals, sh:disjoint
- Logical Constraints: e.g., sh:not, sh:or, sh:xone

### 3. SHACL Syntax and Serialization

SHACL constraints are typically expressed in RDF, using vocabularies defined in the SHACL specification.

#### 3.1 RDF Turtle Syntax

```turtle
ex:PersonShape
  a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Person ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:age ;
    sh:datatype xsd:integer ;
    sh:minInclusive 0 ;
    sh:maxInclusive 150 ;
  ] .
```

#### 3.2 Other Serialization Formats

SHACL can also be expressed in other RDF serialization formats like JSON-LD, RDF/XML, or N-Triples.

### 4. Advanced SHACL Features

#### 4.1 SHACL-SPARQL

SHACL-SPARQL extends SHACL's expressiveness by allowing the use of SPARQL queries to define constraints.

```turtle
ex:CustomConstraintShape
  a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:sparql [
    a sh:SPARQLConstraint ;
    sh:message "Custom constraint violation" ;
    sh:prefixes ex: ;
    sh:select """
      SELECT $this
      WHERE {
        $this ex:someProperty ?value .
        FILTER (?value > 100)
      }
    """ ;
  ] .
```

#### 4.2 SHACL Advanced Features

- Non-Validating Constraints: Used for inferencing or data enrichment rather than validation.
- Shape-based Constraints: Allow referencing other shapes within constraints.
- SHACL Functions: Custom functions that can be used in SHACL-SPARQL constraints.
