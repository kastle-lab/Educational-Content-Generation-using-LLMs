### 1. Fundamentals of Set Theory

Set theory is a fundamental branch of mathematics that forms the basis for many other mathematical disciplines. It deals with the study of sets, which are collections of objects. In this section, we'll explore the basic concepts and definitions that underpin set theory.

#### 1.1 Definition of a Set

A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects. These objects are called elements or members of the set. Sets are typically denoted by capital letters (e.g., A, B, C), and their elements are listed within curly braces {}. For example:

A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

It's important to note that sets are unordered and contain no duplicate elements.

#### 1.2 Set Notation

There are several ways to represent sets:

- Roster notation: Listing all elements (e.g., A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5})
- Set-builder notation: Describing the set's properties (e.g., B = {x | x is an even number less than 10})
- Venn diagrams: Visual representation of sets and their relationships

### 2. Set Operations

Set theory involves various operations that can be performed on sets. Understanding these operations is crucial for working with sets effectively.

#### 2.1 Union

The union of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set containing all elements that are in A, or B, or both. For example:

A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}
A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

#### 2.2 Intersection

The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, is the set containing all elements that are common to both A and B. For example:

A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}
A ∩ B = {3}

#### 2.3 Difference

The difference between two sets A and B, denoted as A - B, is the set of elements that are in A but not in B. For example:

A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
B = {3, 4, 5}
A - B = {1, 2}

#### 2.4 Complement

The complement of a set A with respect to a universal set U, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A. For example:

U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
A = {1, 2, 3}
A' = {4, 5}

### 3. Set Properties

Sets have various properties that govern their behavior and relationships. Understanding these properties is essential for working with sets effectively.

#### 3.1 Subset and Superset

A set A is a subset of set B (denoted as A ⊆ B) if every element of A is also an element of B. Conversely, B is a superset of A (denoted as B ⊇ A).

#### 3.2 Proper Subset and Proper Superset

A set A is a proper subset of set B (denoted as A ⊂ B) if A is a subset of B, but A ≠ B. Similarly, B is a proper superset of A (denoted as B ⊃ A).

#### 3.3 Disjoint Sets

Two sets are disjoint if they have no elements in common, i.e., their intersection is an empty set.

### 4. Cardinality

The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. It is denoted by vertical bars, e.g., |A|.

#### 4.1 Finite Sets

A set is finite if it has a finite number of elements. The cardinality of a finite set is a non-negative integer.

#### 4.2 Infinite Sets

A set is infinite if it is not finite. There are different types of infinite sets, such as countably infinite (e.g., the set of natural numbers) and uncountably infinite (e.g
