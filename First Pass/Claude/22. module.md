# Manchester Syntax

## Content

### 1. Introduction to Manchester Syntax

Manchester Syntax is a user-friendly syntax for describing OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies. Developed as part of the CO-ODE project at the University of Manchester, it was designed to provide a more readable and writable alternative to the verbose XML-based syntaxes traditionally used for OWL.

The primary goal of Manchester Syntax is to make OWL ontologies more accessible to domain experts who may not have extensive knowledge of formal logic or programming languages. It achieves this by using natural language-like constructs and a concise format that is easier to read and write than other OWL syntaxes.

### 2. Historical Context and Development

Manchester Syntax was first introduced in 2006 as part of the development of the Protégé-OWL ontology editor. Its creation was motivated by the need for a more human-readable syntax for OWL, especially for use in graphical user interfaces and for communication with domain experts.

The syntax quickly gained popularity and was subsequently standardized as part of the W3C OWL 2 specification in 2009. This standardization ensured its wide adoption and support across various ontology development tools and platforms.

### 3. Key Features of Manchester Syntax

#### 3.1 Readability

One of the most significant advantages of Manchester Syntax is its readability. It uses keywords and phrases that closely resemble natural language, making it easier for non-experts to understand and work with OWL ontologies.

#### 3.2 Conciseness

Manchester Syntax is more concise than other OWL syntaxes, particularly when compared to RDF/XML. This conciseness makes it easier to write and edit ontologies, especially for complex logical expressions.

#### 3.3 Support for OWL 2 Constructs

Manchester Syntax fully supports all OWL 2 constructs, including class expressions, property restrictions, and axioms. This comprehensive support ensures that ontology developers can express complex semantic relationships and constraints.

### 4. Basic Syntax Elements

#### 4.1 Class Expressions

Class expressions in Manchester Syntax use keywords like 'and', 'or', 'not', and 'some' to represent logical connectives and quantifiers. For example:

```
Person and (hasChild some Doctor)
```

This expression describes a class of people who have at least one child who is a doctor.

#### 4.2 Property Restrictions

Property restrictions are used to describe relationships between classes. Manchester Syntax provides intuitive keywords for various types of restrictions:

- 'some' for existential restrictions
- 'only' for universal restrictions
- 'min', 'max', 'exactly' for cardinality restrictions

For example:

```
hasParent only Human
hasSibling min 2 Person
```

#### 4.3 Class Axioms

Class axioms are used to define relationships between classes. Manchester Syntax uses keywords like 'SubClassOf', 'EquivalentTo', and 'DisjointWith' to express these relationships:

```
Woman SubClassOf Person
Mother EquivalentTo Woman and (hasChild some Person)
Male DisjointWith Female
```

### 5. Advanced Features

#### 5.1 Datatype Restrictions

Manchester Syntax allows for the definition of custom datatypes using facets. For example:

```
xsd:integer[> 0, <= 100]
```

This defines a datatype for integers greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100.

#### 5.2 Annotations

Annotations can be added to entities and axioms using the following syntax:

```
Class: Person
  Annotations: rdfs:label "Human being"
```

#### 5.3 Punning

Manchester Syntax supports OWL 2's feature of punning, which allows the same name to be used for different types of entities:

```
Class: Person
ObjectProperty: Person
```

### 6. Tool Support

Manchester Syntax is widely supported by various ontology development tools and platforms, including:

- Protégé: The most popular ontology editor, which uses Manchester Syntax as its default input format for class expressions and axioms.
- TopBraid Composer: A semantic web modeling environment that supports Manchester Syntax.
- OWL API: A Java API for creating
