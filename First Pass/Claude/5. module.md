# Introduction to Logic

### 1. Fundamentals of Logic

Logic is the systematic study of the principles of valid reasoning and inference. It forms the foundation of critical thinking, mathematics, computer science, and many other disciplines. In this module, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of logic, focusing on propositional logic as a starting point.

#### 1.1 Propositions and Truth Values

A proposition is a declarative statement that is either true or false. For example:

- "The sky is blue" (true)
- "2 + 2 = 5" (false)

Each proposition has a truth value, which is either true (T) or false (F). Understanding propositions is crucial as they form the building blocks of logical reasoning.

#### 1.2 Logical Connectives

Logical connectives are symbols or words used to combine simple propositions into more complex ones. The main logical connectives are:

- Conjunction (AND, ∧): True only when both propositions are true
- Disjunction (OR, ∨): True when at least one proposition is true
- Negation (NOT, ¬): Reverses the truth value of a proposition
- Implication (IF...THEN, →): True except when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false
- Biconditional (IF AND ONLY IF, ↔): True when both propositions have the same truth value

### 2. Boolean Arithmetic

Boolean arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that deals with the manipulation of truth values using logical operations. It's named after George Boole, who developed the algebraic system in the mid-19th century [1].

#### 2.1 Boolean Values and Operations

In Boolean arithmetic, we work with two values: 1 (true) and 0 (false). The basic operations are:

- AND (∧): 1 ∧ 1 = 1, all other combinations = 0
- OR (∨): 0 ∨ 0 = 0, all other combinations = 1
- NOT (¬): ¬0 = 1, ¬1 = 0

#### 2.2 Boolean Algebra Laws

Boolean algebra follows several important laws, including:

- Commutative Laws: A ∧ B = B ∧ A, A ∨ B = B ∨ A
- Associative Laws: (A ∧ B) ∧ C = A ∧ (B ∧ C), (A ∨ B) ∨ C = A ∨ (B ∨ C)
- Distributive Laws: A ∧ (B ∨ C) = (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C), A ∨ (B ∧ C) = (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ C)
- Identity Laws: A ∧ 1 = A, A ∨ 0 = A
- Complement Laws: A ∧ ¬A = 0, A ∨ ¬A = 1

### 3. Truth Tables

Truth tables are tools used to analyze the truth values of complex propositions based on the truth values of their components. They're particularly useful for understanding the behavior of logical connectives and evaluating the validity of arguments.

#### 3.1 Constructing Truth Tables

To construct a truth table:

1. List all unique variables in the leftmost columns
2. Create columns for each subexpression, leading to the final expression
3. Fill in truth values for all possible combinations of the variables
4. Evaluate each subexpression based on the rules of the logical connectives

Example:
For the expression P ∧ (Q ∨ ¬P), the truth table would be:

| P | Q | ¬P | Q ∨ ¬P | P ∧ (Q ∨ ¬P) |
|---|---|----|--------|---------------|
| T | T | F  | T      | T             |
| T | F | F  | F      | F             |
| F | T | T  | T      | F             |
| F |
