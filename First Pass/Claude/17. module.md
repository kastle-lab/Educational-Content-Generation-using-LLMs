# RDF Star

## Content

### 1. Introduction to RDF Star

RDF Star, also known as RDF*, is an extension of the standard Resource Description Framework (RDF) that allows for the creation of more expressive and concise statements about other RDF statements. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with metadata about relationships or when working with property graphs.

#### 1.1 Motivation for RDF Star

Traditional RDF has limitations when it comes to making statements about other statements. The need for RDF Star arose from various use cases where such capabilities were required, including:

- Representing provenance information
- Expressing certainty or uncertainty about statements
- Modeling property graphs in RDF
- Simplifying complex reification patterns

### 2. Core Concepts of RDF Star

#### 2.1 Embedded Triples

The fundamental concept in RDF Star is the embedded triple. An embedded triple allows an entire RDF statement to be used as the subject or object of another statement. This is denoted using double angle brackets (<<...>>).

Example:
```
<<:John :knows :Jane>> :certainty 0.8 .
```

In this example, the statement "John knows Jane" is treated as a single entity and assigned a certainty value.

#### 2.2 Quoted Triples

Quoted triples are similar to embedded triples but are used in contexts where the triple itself is not asserted. They are typically used in SPARQL* queries (an extension of SPARQL for RDF Star).

### 3. RDF Star Syntax

#### 3.1 Turtle* Syntax

Turtle* is an extension of the Turtle serialization format that supports RDF Star. It allows for a human-readable representation of RDF Star graphs.

Example:
```turtle
:Paper1 :title "RDF Star: A New Hope" .
<<:Paper1 :cites :Paper2>> :confidence 0.9 .
```

#### 3.2 TriG* Syntax

TriG* extends the TriG format to support RDF Star, allowing for the representation of multiple RDF* graphs in a single file.

### 4. Use Cases for RDF Star

#### 4.1 Metadata About Relationships

RDF Star excels in scenarios where additional information about relationships needs to be expressed. For instance, in a social network analysis:

```turtle
<<:Alice :follows :Bob>> :since "2022-01-01" .
<<:Alice :follows :Bob>> :strength 0.7 .
```

#### 4.2 Provenance Information

RDF Star simplifies the representation of provenance data:

```turtle
<<:Weather :temperature "25°C">> :measuredBy :Sensor1 .
<<:Weather :temperature "25°C">> :timestamp "2023-06-15T14:30:00Z" .
```

#### 4.3 Certainty and Uncertainty

Expressing degrees of certainty becomes more straightforward:

```turtle
<<:Planet1 :hasLife true>> :probability 0.001 .
```

### 5. Querying RDF Star with SPARQL*

SPARQL*, an extension of SPARQL, allows for querying RDF Star data. It introduces new syntax for working with embedded triples in queries.

Example SPARQL* query:
```sparql
SELECT ?person ?friend ?certainty
WHERE {
  <<?person :knows ?friend>> :certainty ?certainty .
  FILTER(?certainty > 0.5)
}
```

### 6. Challenges and Considerations

#### 6.1 Increased Complexity

While RDF Star offers more expressivity, it also introduces additional complexity in data modeling and querying. Developers and data modelers need to carefully consider when to use embedded triples versus traditional RDF patterns.

#### 6.2 Tool Support

As a relatively new extension, not all RDF tools and triplestores fully support RDF Star. It's important to verify compatibility with existing infrastructure before adopting RDF Star in production environments.

#### 6.3 Performance Implications

The use of embedded triples can have performance implications for storage and querying
