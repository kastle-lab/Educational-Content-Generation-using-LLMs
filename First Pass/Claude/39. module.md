# Survey of Modeling Tools

## Content

### 1. Introduction to Ontology Modeling Tools

Ontology modeling tools are essential software applications that enable knowledge engineers, data scientists, and domain experts to create, edit, and maintain ontologies. These tools provide graphical user interfaces and various functionalities to facilitate the complex process of ontology development. In this survey, we will explore several prominent modeling tools, their features, and their applications in the field of knowledge graph and semantic web technologies.

### 2. Key Features of Ontology Modeling Tools

Before diving into specific tools, it's important to understand the common features that most ontology modeling tools provide:

1. Graphical User Interface (GUI): Allows users to visually create and edit ontologies.
2. Ontology Language Support: Typically supports OWL, RDF, and RDFS.
3. Reasoning Capabilities: Enables logical inference and consistency checking.
4. Collaboration Features: Supports team-based ontology development.
5. Import/Export Functionality: Allows interchange of ontologies in various formats.
6. Visualization: Provides graphical representation of ontology structures.
7. Query Interface: Enables SPARQL or similar query languages for ontology interrogation.
