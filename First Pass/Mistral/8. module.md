# Module 8: Predicate Logic

## Content

### Introduction to Predicate Logic

Predicate logic, also known as first-order logic, is an extension of propositional logic that allows for the expression of more complex logical statements. Unlike propositional logic, which deals only with entire propositions, predicate logic allows statements to be made about objects and their relationships. This module will cover the fundamental concepts, syntax, and semantics of predicate logic, building upon the knowledge gained from propositional logic and Datalog.

### Fundamental Concepts

#### Predicates

Predicates are statements that can be true or false depending on the values of their variables. For example, the statement "x is a human" can be represented as `H(x)`, where `H` is a predicate and `x` is a variable. Predicates can have multiple arguments, such as `L(x, y)` representing "x loves y."

#### Quantifiers

Quantifiers are used to specify the extent to which a predicate applies to a set of objects. There are two main types of quantifiers in predicate logic:

- **Universal Quantifier (∀):** Indicates that a predicate applies to all objects in a set. For example, `∀x P(x)` means "for all x, P(x) is true."
- **Existential Quantifier (∃):** Indicates that there is at least one object in a set for which a predicate is true. For example, `∃x P(x)` means "there exists an x such that P(x) is true."

#### Variables and Constants

Variables represent objects whose values can change, while constants represent specific objects whose values are fixed. For example, in the statement `H(x)`, `x` is a variable, whereas in `H(Socrates)`, `Socrates` is a constant.

### Syntax of Predicate Logic

Predicate logic uses a well-defined syntax to construct logical statements. The basic components include:

- **Predicate Symbols:** Represent predicates, such as `P(x)` for "x is a person."
- **Function Symbols:** Represent functions that map objects to other objects.
- **Variables:** Represent objects whose values can vary.
- **Constants:** Represent specific objects.
- **Logical Connectives:** Include `∧` (and), `∨` (or), `¬` (not), `→` (implies), and `↔` (if and only if).
- **Quantifiers:** Include `∀` (for all) and `∃` (there exists).

### Semantics of Predicate Logic

The semantics of predicate logic deal with the interpretation of logical statements. An interpretation assigns meanings to predicate symbols, function symbols, and constants in a domain. A statement is true under a given interpretation if the interpretation makes the statement true.

#### Truth Values

The truth value of a predicate logic statement depends on the interpretation of its predicates, variables, and constants. For example, the statement `∀x P(x)` is true if `P(x)` is true for every object `x` in the domain.

#### Satisfiability and Validity

- **Satisfiability:** A formula is satisfiable if there is at least one interpretation under which the formula is true.
- **Validity:** A formula is valid if it is true under every possible interpretation.

### Applications of Predicate Logic

Predicate logic has numerous applications in computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. Some key applications include:

- **Databases:** Predicate logic is used to define database queries and constraints.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Predicate logic is used in knowledge representation and reasoning systems.
- **Mathematics:** Predicate logic is used to formalize mathematical theories and proofs.
- **Philosophy:** Predicate logic is used to analyze the structure of arguments and logical reasoning.

### Examples and Exercises

#### Example 1: Formalizing Natural Language Statements

Consider the statement "All humans are mortal." This can be formalized in predicate logic as `∀x (H(x) → M(x))`, where `H(x)` means "x is a human" and `M(x)` means "x is mortal."

#### Example 2: Existential Quantification

The statement "There exists a person who is a philosopher" can be formalized as `∃x (P(x) ∧ Q(x))`, where `P(x)` means "x is a person" and `Q(x)` means "x is a philosopher."

#### Exercise 1: Translate the following statements into predicate logic.

1. All birds can fly.
2. Some birds cannot fly.
3. If x is a human, then x is not a bird.

#### Exercise 2: Determine the truth value of the following statements under the given interpretation.

1. `∀x (P(x) → Q(x))` under the interpretation where `P(x)` is true for all `x` and `Q(x)` is true for all `x`.
2. `∃x (P(x) ∧ ¬Q(x))` under the interpretation where `P(x)` is true for some `x` and `Q(x)` is false for those `x`.
