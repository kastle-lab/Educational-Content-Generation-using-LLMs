# Introduction to Discrete Mathematics

## Content

### Introduction

Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics involving discrete elements and structures. It encompasses topics such as set theory, logic, combinatorics, and graph theory, forming the foundation for various areas of computer science and engineering. This module aims to provide an intermediate-level understanding of discrete mathematics, building upon foundational knowledge in logic and set theory.

### Functionality

#### Definition and Importance

Functionality, also known as functional dependency, is a constraint between two sets of attributes in a database. It is a fundamental concept in relational database theory and plays a crucial role in database normalization. A functional dependency \( X \rightarrow Y \) means that the values of attributes in set \( Y \) are determined by the values of attributes in set \( X \).

For example, in a database table of employees, the employee ID functionally determines the employee's name, meaning that each employee ID corresponds to a unique name.

#### Types of Functional Dependencies

1. **Trivial Functional Dependency:**
   - A functional dependency \( X \rightarrow Y \) is trivial if \( Y \subseteq X \). This means that the set of attributes in \( Y \) is a subset of the set of attributes in \( X \).

2. **Non-Trivial Functional Dependency:**
   - A functional dependency \( X \rightarrow Y \) is non-trivial if \( Y \not\subseteq X \). This means that the set of attributes in \( Y \) is not a subset of the set of attributes in \( X \).

3. **Full Functional Dependency:**
   - A functional dependency \( X \rightarrow Y \) is full if \( Y \) depends on the entire set \( X \) and not on any proper subset of \( X \).

4. **Partial Functional Dependency:**
   - A functional dependency \( X \rightarrow Y \) is partial if there exists a proper subset \( Z \) of \( X \) such that \( Z \rightarrow Y \).

### Reflexivity

#### Definition and Examples

Reflexivity is a property of binary relations where an element is related to itself. In mathematical terms, a relation \( R \) on a set \( A \) is reflexive if for every \( a \in A \), the pair \( (a, a) \) is in \( R \).

For example, the equality relation \( = \) is reflexive because any element is equal to itself.

#### Applications in Discrete Mathematics

Reflexivity is a fundamental property in the study of equivalence relations and partially ordered sets. It is used to define mathematical structures such as reflexive graphs and reflexive closures.

### Transitivity

#### Definition and Examples

Transitivity is a property of binary relations where if an element is related to a second element, and the second element is related to a third element, then the first element is also related to the third element. Formally, a relation \( R \) on a set \( A \) is transitive if for all \( a, b, c \in A \), if \( (a, b) \in R \) and \( (b, c) \in R \), then \( (a, c) \in R \).

For example, the "less than or equal to" relation \( \leq \) is transitive because if \( a \leq b \) and \( b \leq c \), then \( a \leq c \).

#### Applications in Discrete Mathematics

Transitivity is crucial in the study of order relations, equivalence relations, and topological spaces. It helps in defining and understanding the structure of various mathematical objects.

### Inverse

#### Definition and Examples

The inverse of a function \( f \) is a function \( f^{-1} \) that undoes the operation of \( f \). Formally, if \( f: A \rightarrow B \) is a function, then \( f^{-1}: B \rightarrow A \) is its inverse if \( f(f^{-1}(b)) = b \) for all \( b \in B \) and \( f^{-1}(f(a)) = a \) for all \( a \in A \).

For example, the inverse of the function \( f(x) = x + 1 \) is \( f^{-1}(x) = x - 1 \).

#### Properties of Inverses

1. **Uniqueness:**
   - If a function has an inverse, it is unique.

2. **Existence:**
   - Not all functions have inverses. A function has an inverse if and only if it is bijective (one-to-one and onto).

### Domain

#### Definition and Examples

The domain of a function is the set of all possible inputs for the function. Formally, if \( f: A \rightarrow B \) is a function, then the domain of \( f \) is the set \( A \).

For example, the domain of the function \( f(x) = \sqrt{x} \) is the set of all non-negative real numbers.

#### Importance in Discrete Mathematics

The domain is crucial in defining the range and codomain of a function. It helps in understanding the behavior of functions and their properties.

### Range

#### Definition and Examples

The range of a function is the set of all possible outputs of the function. Formally, if \( f: A \rightarrow B \) is a function, then the range of \( f \) is the set \( \{ f(a) \mid a \in A \} \).

For example, the range of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) is the set of all non-negative real numbers.

#### Importance in Discrete Mathematics

The range is essential in understanding the mapping of functions and their inverses. It plays a crucial role in determining the surjectivity of a function.
