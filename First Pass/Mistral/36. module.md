### Importance of Visualization Tools

Visualization tools are essential for several reasons:

1. **Understanding Complex Data:** They help in making sense of large and complex datasets by providing intuitive visual representations.
2. **Exploration and Analysis:** Visualization tools allow users to explore data interactively and perform in-depth analysis.
3. **Communication:** Effective visualizations can communicate insights and findings more clearly than textual descriptions alone.
4. **Decision Making:** Visual tools can aid in making data-driven decisions by providing a clear picture of the data landscape.

### Types of Visualization Tools

Visualization tools can be categorized based on their functionalities and target audiences. Here are some of the primary types:

1. **Graph Visualization Tools:** These tools are designed to visualize networks and relationships. They are particularly useful for knowledge graphs.
2. **Data Visualization Tools:** These tools focus on visualizing data in various formats such as charts, graphs, and maps.
3. **Geospatial Visualization Tools:** These tools specialize in visualizing geographical data and are useful for location-based knowledge graphs.
