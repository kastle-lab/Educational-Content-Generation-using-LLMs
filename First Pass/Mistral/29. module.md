# Survey of Modeling Tools

## Content

### Introduction

Modeling tools play a crucial role in the development and management of knowledge graphs. These tools provide a structured way to define, visualize, and manage the schemas and data within a knowledge graph. This module will survey several prominent modeling tools, including Protege, TopBraid Composer, PoolParty, and DataWorld. Each tool has its unique features and use cases, making them suitable for different types of projects and users.

### Protege

#### Overview

Protege is an open-source ontology editor and knowledge-base framework. It is widely used in the academic and research communities for creating and managing ontologies. Protege supports the development of ontologies in various formats, including OWL, RDF, and RDFS.

#### Features

- **Ontology Editing:** Protege provides a user-friendly interface for creating and editing ontologies. It supports the definition of classes, properties, individuals, and relationships.
- **Reasoning:** Protege integrates with reasoners such as HermiT, Pellet, and FaCT++, which allow users to perform logical inference and consistency checking on their ontologies.
- **Plugins:** Protege has a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality. These plugins can be used for visualization, validation, and integration with other tools.
- **Collaborative Work:** Protege supports collaborative ontology development through its WebProtege platform, which allows multiple users to work on the same ontology simultaneously.

#### Use Cases

Protege is widely used in biomedical research, where it is used to create ontologies for representing biological data. It is also used in other domains such as education, engineering, and social sciences.

### TopBraid Composer

#### Overview

TopBraid Composer is a commercial ontology development and management tool. It is designed to support the creation, editing, and deployment of ontologies and knowledge graphs. TopBraid Composer offers advanced features and integrates with various data sources and technologies.

#### Features

- **Visual Modeling:** TopBraid Composer provides a visual modeling environment that allows users to create and edit ontologies using drag-and-drop interfaces.
- **Data Integration:** TopBraid Composer supports the integration of data from various sources, including databases, spreadsheets, and web services.
- **SPARQL Endpoint:** TopBraid Composer includes a built-in SPARQL endpoint, which allows users to query their knowledge graphs using the SPARQL query language.
- **Rule-based Reasoning:** TopBraid Composer supports rule-based reasoning, allowing users to define and execute business rules on their knowledge graphs.

#### Use Cases

TopBraid Composer is used in industries such as finance, healthcare, and government for creating and managing large-scale knowledge graphs. It is also used in academic research for developing complex ontologies and knowledge graphs.

### PoolParty

#### Overview

PoolParty is a semantic technology suite that provides tools for creating, managing, and publishing taxonomies, thesauri, and ontologies. It is designed to support the development of knowledge graphs and linked data applications.

#### Features

- **Taxonomy Management:** PoolParty provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating and managing taxonomies and thesauri. It supports the definition of hierarchical relationships, synonyms, and other semantic properties.
- **Linked Data:** PoolParty supports the creation and management of linked data, allowing users to link their data to external data sources and ontologies.
- **SKOS Support:** PoolParty supports the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), which is a standard for representing taxonomies and thesauri in RDF.
- **Collaboration:** PoolParty supports collaborative development, allowing multiple users to work on the same taxonomy or ontology simultaneously.

#### Use Cases

PoolParty is used in industries such as media, publishing, and e-commerce for creating and managing taxonomies and thesauri. It is also used in academic research for developing linked data applications and knowledge graphs.

### DataWorld

#### Overview

DataWorld is a data catalog and collaboration platform that provides tools for managing and sharing data. It supports the creation and management of data catalogs, which can be used to organize and document data assets.

#### Features

- **Data Cataloging:** DataWorld provides tools for creating and managing data catalogs, which can be used to document and organize data assets.
- **Collaboration:** DataWorld supports collaborative data management, allowing multiple users to work on the same data catalog simultaneously.
- **Data Integration:** DataWorld supports the integration of data from various sources, including databases, spreadsheets, and web services.
- **Data Governance:** DataWorld provides tools for data governance, including data quality management, data lineage, and data access control.

#### Use Cases

DataWorld is used in industries such as finance, healthcare, and government for managing and sharing data. It is also used in academic research for creating and managing data catalogs and linked data applications.
