##### 1. Introduction to Sets

Sets are fundamental objects in mathematics and form the basis for many other concepts in discrete mathematics, logic, and computer science. A set is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. The objects that make up a set are called its elements or members.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Set Definition:** A set is a collection of well-defined and distinct objects.
- **Membership:** An element is either a member of a set or not. This is denoted by the symbol ∈ (is an element of) or ∉ (is not an element of).

**Example:**
If A = {1, 2, 3}, then 2 ∈ A and 4 ∉ A.

##### 2. Union of Sets

The union of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that belong to either A or B or both. The union operation is denoted by the symbol ∪.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Union Definition:** A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}.
- **Properties of Union:**
  - Commutativity: A ∪ B = B ∪ A.
  - Associativity: (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C).
  - Identity: A ∪ ∅ = A.
  - Idempotence: A ∪ A = A.

**Example:**
If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5}, then A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

##### 3. Disjunction in Set Theory

Disjunction in set theory refers to the logical operation of "or" used to combine sets. It is closely related to the union operation.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Logical Disjunction:** A or B is true if at least one of A or B is true.
- **Disjunction in Sets:** The union operation can be seen as a disjunction of sets.

**Example:**
For sets A and B, the statement "x ∈ A or x ∈ B" is true if x is in the union of A and B.

##### 4. Disjointness of Sets

Two sets are said to be disjoint if they have no elements in common. This concept is crucial in many applications of set theory.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Disjoint Definition:** Sets A and B are disjoint if A ∩ B = ∅.
- **Pairwise Disjoint:** A collection of sets is pairwise disjoint if every pair of sets in the collection is disjoint.

**Example:**
If A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}, then A and B are disjoint because A ∩ B = ∅.

##### 5. Intersection of Sets

The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that belong to both A and B. The intersection operation is denoted by the symbol ∩.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Intersection Definition:** A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}.
- **Properties of Intersection:**
  - Commutativity: A ∩ B = B ∩ A.
  - Associativity: (A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C).
  - Identity: A ∩ U = A, where U is the universal set.
  - Idempotence: A ∩ A = A.

**Example:**
If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5}, then A ∩ B = {3}.

##### 6. Cardinality of Sets

The cardinality of a set is a measure of the number of elements in the set. For finite sets, the cardinality is simply the number of elements.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Cardinality Definition:** The cardinality of a set A, denoted |A|, is the number of elements in A.
- **Finite and Infinite Sets:** A set is finite if it has a finite number of elements; otherwise, it is infinite.

**Example:**
If A = {1, 2, 3}, then |A| = 3.

##### 7. Tuples and Graphs

Tuples are ordered lists of elements, and graphs are sets of vertices connected by edges. These concepts are fundamental in computer science and discrete mathematics.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Tuple Definition:** An n-tuple is an ordered list of n elements.
- **Graph Definition:** A graph G is a pair (V, E) where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges connecting the vertices.

**Example:**
- A 3-tuple (a, b, c) is an ordered list of three elements.
- A graph G = (V, E) with V = {1, 2, 3} and E = {(1, 2), (2, 3)} has three vertices and two edges.
