### Introduction to SKOS

**Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)** is a common data model for sharing and linking knowledge organization systems via the Web. SKOS provides a model for expressing the basic structure and content of concept schemes such as thesauri, classification schemes, taxonomies, subject-heading systems, and other types of controlled vocabulary. SKOS is built on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL), enabling the integration of knowledge organization systems within the broader framework of the Semantic Web.

### Understanding the Basic Concepts

#### Concept

A **Concept** in SKOS is a unit of thought that may be used to represent an idea, object, or category. Concepts are the fundamental building blocks of a knowledge organization system. Each concept is identified by a URI, which allows it to be uniquely referenced and linked to other resources on the web.

```rdf
ex:animal rdf:type skos:Concept .
```

#### Concept Scheme

A **Concept Scheme** is a set of concepts. It provides a way to group related concepts together. Each concept scheme is also identified by a URI. Concept schemes are particularly useful for organizing large sets of concepts into manageable subsets.

```rdf
ex:animalsScheme rdf:type skos:ConceptScheme .
ex:animal skos:inScheme ex:animalsScheme .
```

#### Labels

**Labels** are used to provide human-readable names for concepts. SKOS defines three types of labels:

1. **Preferred Label (skos:prefLabel)**: The primary label for a concept.
2. **Alternative Label (skos:altLabel)**: Additional labels that are synonyms or near-synonyms of the preferred label.
3. **Hidden Label (skos:hiddenLabel)**: Labels that are not suitable for display but may be useful for search and indexing purposes.

```rdf
ex:animal skos:prefLabel "Animal"@en .
ex:animal skos:altLabel "Creature"@en .
ex:animal skos:hiddenLabel "Beast"@en .
```

### Relationships Between Concepts

#### Hierarchical Relationships

Hierarchical relationships define the broader and narrower relationships between concepts. SKOS provides two properties for this purpose:

1. **Broader Concept (skos:broader)**: Indicates that one concept is broader than another.
2. **Narrower Concept (skos:narrower)**: Indicates that one concept is narrower than another.

```rdf
ex:mammal skos:broader ex:animal .
ex:dog skos:narrower ex:mammal .
```

#### Associative Relationships

Associative relationships define non-hierarchical relationships between concepts. SKOS provides the `skos:related` property for this purpose.

```rdf
ex:dog skos:related ex:cat .
```

### Semantic Relations

Semantic relations define the meaning of concepts in relation to other concepts. SKOS provides properties such as `skos:semanticRelation`, `skos:broaderTransitive`, and `skos:narrowerTransitive` to express these relationships.

```rdf
ex:dog skos:broaderTransitive ex:animal .
ex:mammal skos:narrowerTransitive ex:dog .
```

### Mapping Relationships

Mapping relationships define the relationships between concepts in different concept schemes. SKOS provides properties such as `skos:closeMatch`, `skos:exactMatch`, `skos:broadMatch`, and `skos:narrowMatch` to express these relationships.

```rdf
ex:dog skos:exactMatch ex:canine .
```

### Documentation Properties

Documentation properties provide additional information about concepts, such as definitions, examples, and notes. SKOS provides properties such as `skos:definition`, `skos:example`, and `skos:note` for this purpose.

```rdf
ex:animal skos:definition "A living organism that feeds on organic matter."@en .
ex:animal skos:example "A dog is an example of an animal."@en .
ex:animal skos:note "Animals are classified into various categories based on their characteristics."@en .
```

### SKOS Extensions

SKOS can be extended to include additional properties and classes to meet the specific needs of a knowledge organization system. For example, SKOS-XL (SKOS eXtension for Labels) provides a way to represent labels as resources, allowing for more detailed modeling of labels.

### Applications of SKOS

SKOS has been widely adopted in various domains for organizing and sharing knowledge. Some of the notable applications include:

- **Library and Information Science**: SKOS is used to represent thesauri, classification schemes, and subject heading systems.
- **Biomedical Informatics**: SKOS is used to represent controlled vocabularies and ontologies in the biomedical domain.
- **Geospatial Information**: SKOS is used to represent geographic concepts and relationships.

### Tools and Technologies

Several tools and technologies support the creation, management, and use of SKOS vocabularies. Some of the popular tools include:

- **Protégé**: An open-source ontology editor that supports SKOS.
- **PoolParty**: A semantic suite that provides tools for creating and managing SKOS vocabularies.
- **TopBraid Composer**: A commercial ontology editor that supports SKOS.
