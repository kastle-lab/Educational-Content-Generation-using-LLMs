# Second Pass

## Differences from Previous Phase

- Max tokens for content generation prompt doubled (increased to 8000 tk)

## Observations

- Content did not abruptly halt mid-generation process (especially Claude)
- GPT4o has a brief overview with only essentials but lacks details and in-depth coverage
- Claude has comprehensive module content with history. Advanced topics etc but maybe a little too over-comprehensive? - depends on the audience-defined
- Mistral gives sufficient details but also sometimes misses advanced topic coverage due to enhanced concentration on the readability of sufficient details
- Claude and Mistral have the best examples while GPT examples are hard to understand as its very generic. Mistral example explanation was even more impressive
